Welcome to miniFaceApp !

This is a side project that came to my mind as I was learning about Variational Autoencoders (VAE). 

I implemented VAEs from scratch and experimented with them, initially on MNIST, then on the CelebFaces Attributes dataset.

Then I played with the latent representations, and build a front-end UI to enable others to play with them too.

Have fun :)
